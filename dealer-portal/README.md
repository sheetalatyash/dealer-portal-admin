✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start an application

**If you have a fresh copy of the repository, you will need to build the portal theme for the correct styles to be applied. Simple run `npm run build` while in the `dealer-portal` folder.**

Run `npm run <app-name>` to lint the app source code and start the development server. Happy coding!

e.g. `npm run user-admin`, `npm run communications`, etc

## Debug an application

These instructions are for the VS Code editor. **You must have the root repository folder opened as the root workspace folder for the editor for the proper debug commands to display**

There are two ways to start debugging an application.

##### Option 1: VS Code App Debug Command

1. Go to the Run and Debug sidebar menu (Ctrl+Shift+D).
1. Along the top bar, click the drop down and select the `Debug <Your-App>` option
1. Click the green play button to start the debug session
1. The app will be served and a debug browser will open

##### Option 2: Terminal Command

1. Open up a terminal window and run the command `npx nx run <your-app-name>:serve --configuration=local`
1. Once running, go to VS Code and then the Run and Debug sidebar menu (Ctrl+Shift+D).
1. Along the top bar, click the drop down and select the `Debug <Your-App>` option
1. Click the green play button to start the debug session
1. The debug browser will open

You may have to refresh the debug browser once before breakpoints become bound to the application.

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build <your-app-name>` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Create a new application

## @see docs/new-application - This will eventually get changed out for creating our own template!

### Debug Config

Under the repository root `.vscode/launch.json` you can add a VS Code debug configuration for the new application. Add the entry alphabetically by the configuration name to the list of `configurations` in that file:

```
{
  "command": "npx nx run <your-app-name>:serve --configuration=local",
  "name": "Debug <Your-App-Name>",
  "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/dealer-portal",
  "request": "launch",
  "type": "node-terminal",
  "serverReadyAction": {
    "action": "startDebugging",
    "name": "Launch Chrome Debugger",
    "pattern": "http://localhost:4200/"
  }
}
```

## Create a Service

To create a service for a particular application, you can run the following command for the files to be generated in the correct folder structure. The command should be run in the `dealer_portal` folder.

```
npx nx generate @nx/angular:service ../services/<service-name>/<service-name> --project=<app-name>
```

You do **not** need to include _service_ at the end of your `service-name`

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
